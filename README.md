# Rotten Chess ðŸ¤¢
### ~~What is Rotten Chess?~~ What will Rotten Chess become?
Rotten chess will be a leaderboard website tracking the number of inaccuracies, mistakes, and blunders that top players make in their most mistake-ridden and <ins>Rotten Chess</ins> games. 
Considering how good these players are, it's interesting to see how many mistakes are made in low time formats.

## How does Rotten Chess work?
Rotten Chess tracks games on <ins>Chess.com</ins> from players in the <ins>Top 50 leaderboard for Blitz</ins> as well as some selected chess personalities like [GothamChess](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCQHX6ViZmPsWiYSFAyS0a3Q) and [Alexandrea Botez](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCAn8NrZ-J4CRfwodajqFYoQ).
Blitz was selected as it is the most popular chess format on the website among top players.

### Importing Games
The Lambda function `import_player_games` retrieves games and other relevant information about tracked players on Chess.com via API calls. 

The list of players being tracked changes dynamically with how the leaderboard on Chess.com changes. Players who leave the leaderboard will have their games tracked for an additional month to have continouity in their game stats if they happen to return to the leaderboard shortly after. They will be removed from the list of tracked players after a month outside of the leaderboard to limit the amount of individuals being tracked. 

This function specifically tracks:
- **Top 50 Blitz Players**: Players ranked in the top 50 in the Blitz category
- **Tracked Personalities and Players**: Curated list of chess personalities and other players of interest ([like myself](https://www.chess.com/member/markoj000))

### Storage

The collected games and player information is stored in 3 separate DynamoDB Tables. After referencing the items in the Tracked Players Table, games of tracked players are imported into the Game Imports Table which are later used for analysis. All past and present tracked players have their complete data profile stored in the Player Stats Table. This allows for some data continouity for individuals who have not been tracked for a long time. 

#### Game Imports Table
Stores information about the games played by tracked players.

```
{
    "game_uuid": "c189b116-1d45-11ef-855f-6cfe544c0428", # Primary Key
    "black": "RantomOpening"
    "end_time": 1716937572,
    "game_url": "https://www.chess.com/game/live/110676101507", 
    "moves": "e4 c5 a3 e6 ...",
    "time_class": "blitz",
    "white": "GothamChess"
},
...
```
---

 #### Tracked Players Table
 
 Maintains a dynamic list of all the players being tracked. Top 50 players have a `"last_seen"` attribute which is used in the dynamic leaderboard tracking system.
 Chess personalities do not have this attribute since their tracking is done on a permenant basis.
 
```
{
  "username": "MagnusCarlsen",
  "is_leaderboard_player": true,
  "last_seen": "06-03-2024"
}
```
```
{
  "username": "annacramling",
  "is_leaderboard_player": false
}
```
---

#### Player Stats Table
Further information on tracked players used for the website, including finalized results from analysis. When a player starts being tracked, a data profile is initialized. Once a game has been analyzed, a game_stats folder is initializied. Game analysis results are stored by the month the games occured, and these months are stored by year.
 
 ```
{
  "username": "DanielNaroditsky",
  "country": "US",
  "game_stats": {
    "y2024": {
     "player_total": {
     "blunders": 119,
     "inaccuracies": 264,
     "mistakes": 141
      }
      "m06": {
        "player_total": {
          "blunders": 44,
          "inaccuracies": 57,
          "mistakes": 87
        },
     },
    ...
    },
  ...
  }
  "player_name": "Daniel Naroditsky",
  "player_rank": 17,
  "player_title": "GM",
  "rating": 3100
}
```

### Processing Games
Once the Game Imports Table is populated, the Simple Queue Service (SQS) is utilized to gather games in batches using the `enqueue_dynamodb_items` function to prepare games for processing.

The Elastic Container Service (ECS) is used to deploy multiple Docker Containers. Each Container has:
- **Stockfish Chess Engine:** A very strong chess engine
- **analysis.py:** A script utilizing the engine to analyze games to gather the numbers of blunders, mistakes, and inaccuracies

---
#### Win Percentage Calculation
To determine these metrics, Stockfish analyzes each move in a game at a <ins>Depth of 20</ins> to determine the centipawn value. This value is put through the following function which calculates the win percentage
based on a players centipawn value. This is the same function [used by Lichess]() in their classifications of moves. 
 ```
 Win% = 50 + 50 * (2 / (1 + exp(-0.00368208 * centipawns)) - 1)
 ```
---
#### Move Classification
By referencing the change in percentage value between moves, we can determine what a move is classified as. The current bounds are used for move classification:
```
Blunder = win_prob_change >= 0.2        
Mistake = 0.05 < win_prob_change >= 0.1
Inaccuracy = 0 < win_prob_change >= 0.05
```
---
#### Analysis
Docker Containers grab messages from the SQS queue and run the game moves through the script located on the image.
The number of containers deploys one-to-one with the number of messages within the SQS Queue, ensuring that the compute infrastructure scales with the number of games played on any day. 
Results are sent to the Player Stats Table. 

### Provisioning / Deprovisioning PrivateLinks
To save on costs, PrivateLinks for services like the **Elastic Container Registry (ECR)**, and **CloudWatch** are provisioned using the `provision_privatelinks` function only when needed. After all processing is complete, these PrivateLinks are deprovisioned using the `deprovision_privatelinks` function. This results in a **83% lower cost** associated with PrivateLinks.
